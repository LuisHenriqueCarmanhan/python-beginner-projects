# 🐍 Python Beginner Projects

This repository contains exercises and small projects developed during my initial learning phase in Python.

The goal is to explore, practice, and gradually apply programming logic, core Python concepts, and basic best practices as they are introduced during my studies.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The topics below represent concepts studied and practiced throughout the learning process, not necessarily all used in every project.

- Variables and data types  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Functions  
- Lists and dictionaries  
- Input and output  
- String manipulation and formatting (f-strings)
- Standard Libraries (random, math, time)

## 📂 Projects

- `calculator.py` → Simple terminal calculator
- `guessing_game.py` → A Matrix-themed game where you guess a number between 0-5. Features random logic and input validation.
- `triangle_validator_and_classifier.py` → Validates if segments form a triangle and classifies them (Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene) with a custom geometric UI.
- `travel_cost.py` → Calculates ticket prices based on trip distance using conditional pricing for long and short distances.
- `temperature_converter.py` → Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit  
- `multiplication_table.py` → Generates a multiplication table  
- `even_or_odd.py` → Checks whether a number is even or odd  
- `student_order.py` → Randomly shuffles a list of students using Python’s standard random library  
- `text_analyzer.py` → Analyzes a full name, displaying it in uppercase/lowercase and counting total letters.  
- `digit_separator.py` → Separates a number into its mathematical components (units, tens, etc.) using string indexing.  
- `name_parser.py` → Uses string splitting to extract and display the first and last name of a user.
