# 🐍 Python Beginner Projects

This repository contains exercises and small projects developed during my initial learning phase in Python.

The goal is to explore, practice, and gradually apply programming logic, core Python concepts, and basic best practices as they are introduced during my studies.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

The topics below represent concepts studied and practiced throughout the learning process:

- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Functions
- Lists and dictionaries
- Input and output
- String manipulation and formatting (f-strings)
- Standard Libraries (random, math, time)

## 📂 Projects

### ⭐ Featured Projects
- guessing_game.py → Matrix-themed number guessing game with random logic and validation.
- triangle_validator_and_classifier.py → Validates segments and classifies triangles with custom UI.
- calculator.py → Simple terminal calculator for basic mathematical operations.
- text_analyzer.py → Analyzes names by changing case and counting total letters.

### 🛠️ Foundational Exercises
- travel_cost.py → Calculates ticket prices based on distance using conditional pricing.
- temperature_converter.py → Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using standard formulas.
- multiplication_table.py → Generates a multiplication table for a chosen number.
- even_or_odd.py → Basic check to determine if a number is even or odd.
- student_order.py → Randomly shuffles a list of student names using the random library.
- digit_separator.py → Separates numbers into mathematical units using string indexing.
- name_parser.py → Extracts and displays first and last names via string splitting.
